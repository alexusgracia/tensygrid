# MTI-Toolbox
Tools for Multilinear Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis


## Requirements & Installation
For full functionality the following MATLAB(R) Products are required:
Control System Toolbox
System Identification Toolbox
Optimzation Toolbox
Global Optimzation Toolbox
Symbolic Math Toolbox (MuPad)

For approximating a Simulink(R)-Model as a MTI  (mlinearize) [The Sparse Grids Mitlab Kit](https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-grids-kit) is required.
The MTI-Toolbox supports ktensors from [Tensor Toolbox](https://www.tensortoolbox.org), but this functionality depends on the Tensor Toolbox being installed.

### Installer
Using the .mltbx Installer "The Sparse Grids Mitlab Kit" and "Tensor Toolbox" are automatically installed and added to the MATLAB(R) path.
The MATLAB(R) Toolboxes need to be installed manually.

### Manual installation using the .zip Archive
When installing the Toolbox from the .zip archive, unpack the contents to a persistent location of your choice and add the complete "mti-toolbox" folder to your MATLAB(R) path.
The requirements must be satisfied manually.
